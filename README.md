Getting Started:
---
You will need at least python 3.7 to execute the program <br>
Recommend creating a virtual environment so that it doesn't install everything into the home directory of python installation by using venv command, example:
>$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
---
Activate the environment by using source command and:
>$ source /yourdirectory/bin/activate
---
To deactivate the virtual environment use deactivate command:
>$ deactivate
---
Add the required libraries for the code using the pip command
>$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt -f file:///path/to/archive/
  
On first time execution you will get _"paste our link here.txt"_ where you can enter your link <br>
Also on execution if the export folder is not present it will create that as well<br>
Now enter the video link in _"paste our link here.txt"_ in the same directory and run the program again<br>
Result for the execution will be saved in **_export_** folder<br>
All files will be saved in format <**_file type_ videoID timestamp.txt**>
